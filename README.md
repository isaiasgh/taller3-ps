# Student Information Management System

This project implements a client-server model written in C to simulate a system that stores and manages student information, including details about their career, faculty, subjects, and grades. 

## Features

- Store and retrieve information about students.
- Manage student data through a simple command-line interface.
- Modify student details such as:
  - For Career:
    1. Change average grade
    2. Change number of approved subjects
    3. Change number of failed subjects
  - For Faculty:
    1. Change faculty
    2. Change career
- Error handling for various operations, including:
  - `F___`: Faculty code
  - `C____`: Career code
  - `e9090`: Error while searching for a student
